**PTC Monitor Dashboard** is a lightweight, serverless web application designed to track the progress of quality improvement plans within the Pharmacy Department. Built with **Vue 3** and **TypeScript**, it utilizes **Google Sheets** as a zero-cost database via **Google Apps Script (GAS)**, making it incredibly easy to deploy and maintain within healthcare organizations without requiring traditional backend infrastructure.

## Overview & Features

This dashboard helps the PTC team track the status and progress of 12 critical actions across 3 improvement proposals.

- **Clinical Dark Interface:** Designed for extended professional use with a high-contrast dark theme, custom EKG pulse animations, and integrated sparkline charts.
- **Optimistic UI Updates:** Instant visual feedback when updating action statuses or progress, ensuring a responsive user experience while background synchronization occurs.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Features an automated Gantt chart for fiscal year tracking and a dynamic summary dashboard reflecting real-time progress.
- **Smart Alerting:** Automatically filters and highlights tasks marked as "Blocked" or "Delayed" for immediate managerial attention.
- **Zero-Cost Infrastructure:** Uses a Google Apps Script Web App to read and write directly to a Google Sheet, completely eliminating the need for server maintenance.

- **Frontend:** Single Page Application (SPA) hosted on Vercel. Communicates via standard JSON APIs.
- **Backend (GAS):** Parses HTTP requests, bypasses CORS preflight limitations using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, and executes read/write operations.
- **Database:** Google Sheets (Sheet name: `ActionProgress`).

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- A Google Account (to create the backing Google Sheet and Apps Script)

### 1. Frontend Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/pharmacist-sabot/ptc-dashboard.git
   cd ptc-dashboard
   npm install
   ```
2. Set up your local environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
3. Start the development server (Note: You must complete the GAS setup below and update `VITE_GAS_URL` in your `.env.local` before the app can fetch data):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 2. Backend Setup (Google Apps Script)

1. Create a new **Google Sheet**.
2. Navigate to **Extensions > Apps Script**.
3. Replace the default code with the contents of [`src/gas/Code.gs`](src/gas/Code.gs).
4. Save the project.
5. Click **Deploy > New deployment**.
   - **Select type:** Web app
   - **Execute as:** Me (your email address)
   - **Who has access:** Anyone
6. Click **Deploy** and authorize the required permissions.
7. Copy the generated **Web app URL**.
8. Paste the URL into your `.env.local` file:
   ```env
   VITE_GAS_URL=https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec
   ```

---

## Deployment

The project is pre-configured for seamless deployment on **Vercel** via the included `vercel.json` file.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FYOUR_ORG%2Fptc-dashboard&env=VITE_GAS_URL)

**Manual Vercel Deployment:**

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Import the repository into your Vercel dashboard.
3. Ensure the Framework Preset is set to **Vite**.
4. In the **Environment Variables** section, add:
   - Name: `VITE_GAS_URL`
   - Value: `[Your GAS Web App URL]`
5. Click **Deploy**.

## Database Schema

Upon the first API execution, the Google Apps Script will automatically generate a sheet named `ActionProgress` with the following columns:

| Column        | Type     | Description                                                     |
| :------------ | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`          | String   | Unique action identifier (e.g., `R1A1`, `R2A3`)                 |
| `status`      | String   | `not_started`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `delayed`, `blocked` |
| `progressPct` | Number   | Completion percentage (0-100)                                   |
| `actualValue` | String   | The actual recorded KPI value                                   |
| `notes`       | String   | Free-text operational notes                                     |
| `blockers`    | String   | Documented risks or obstacles                                   |
| `lastUpdated` | ISO Date | Timestamp of the last modification                              |
| `updatedBy`   | String   | Identifier of the user making the update                        |

## Security & Privacy

- **Data Sensitivity:** This application is strictly intended for tracking operational processes and policy implementation. **Do not** store Protected Health Information (PHI), patient identifiers, or highly confidential institutional data in this system.
- **Endpoint Protection:** Treat your GAS Web App URL as a sensitive credential. Do not commit it to public version control. Utilize proper secret management (e.g., Vercel Environment Variables).
- **Access Control:** Restrict the sharing permissions of the backend Google Sheet to authorized personnel only.
